                <p> 
                    Killarney is a <b>quaint picturesque</b> town found in County Kerry, in the rural south of Ireland. Because its population and size aren't all that big, 
                    some may think it to be a little known about, forgotten town. However Killarney is a town known not only in Ireland, but throughout the world, 
                    for its breath-taking scenery and fascinating history. It is one of Ireland's biggest tourist hubs, famed in song and story, 
                    and thousands flock to this charismatic town every year to witness its natural beauty and experience the magic of Killarney for themselves.

                <h2>Killarney's Name: Where does it come from?</h2>

                <p>
                    Killarney gets it's name from the Irish Words <i lang="ga">Cill Airne</i> and means <i>Church of the Sloes</i>, 
                    or <i>Church of the Blackthorn</i>. Nobody really seem to know the origin of the name, 
                    but the protestant Church, St Mary's Church, in Killarney, is rumoured to have been built on the site of Killarney's namesake.

                <h3>Location: Where does Killarney Find Itself</h3>

                <p> Killarney finds itself in the western most county in Ireland, County Kerry. Kerry itself is one of the largest counties in Ireland, 
                    with an area of 4,807 km<sup>2</sup>, and is the country's fifth biggest county. Killarney has a big presence in the county, being the second biggest urban area in the county, 
                    and the town attracts thousands of tourists each year because of it's natural beauty. 
                </p>

                <p> Situated at the base of Ireland's highest mountain range and with the town found on the north-eastern most shore of Lough Leane, between the <i>Flesk</i> and <i>Deenagh</i> rivers, 
                    Killarney is flanked with natural scenery on all sides. 
                </p>

                <p> As is discussed <a href="killarney_national_park.html">Here</a> Killarney National Park is probably the towns biggest geographical feature.</p>

            </section>

            <section id="demographics">
                <h2>Demographics of Killarney</h2>

                <p> Despite the many conquests, plantations, and movement people in the area of Killarney, for much of history, 
                    the people of Killarney were mostly homogenous, at-least culturally speaking. 
                    The people of the area spoke the same languages and practiced the same faiths. Irish was the main language for much history, 
                    and the people transitioned from pagans to Christians when the time came. 
                </p>
                
                <p> In the past, life expectancy wasn't high. Infant and child mortality was high, and mothers often died giving birth. 
                    Children were seen as workers, so families were big, but people did not live very long. This isn't the case with modern killarney today,
                    who's population has soared to fourteen thousand. During the summer, the natives do tend to get outnumbered by tourists.
                </p>

                <p> Here are some facts about Killarney's population, some of which may surprise you, all according to the 2016 census data;</p>

                <ul><li>Killarney today has an aging population, with the <b>average age</b> of residents being <b>39</b>. In-fact, 
                    the age group with the biggest population is people in their 30s. A lot less people are being born today in Killarney compared to three or four decades ago</li>
                    <li>Women outnumber men <b>1:0.91</b>. For younger age groups the number is more even.</li>
                    <li>A significant proportion of people in Killarney don't have Irish citizenship, with the Polish being the biggest group at around 11%. 
                        Poland is also the area with highest recorded place of birth for Killarney residents, of course besides Ireland.</li>
                    <li>Only 78% of people report to be catholic, however as we know, many are non-practicing. 
                        A good proportion, 14%, of people report to having no religion.</li>
                    <li>Only a third of people have some speaking ability of the Irish language. Considering Irish is mandatory in school, this is quite surprising.</li>
                    <li>And finally only 90% of people are white in Killarney, with Asians at 5% the biggest race out of those remaining.</li>
                </ul>

                <p> Killarney is becoming less and less like it was in the past, but the new editions to the town have been more than welcome. 
                    In a country where seventy million people abroad claim Irish heritage, 
                    the fact that Killarney's population is increasing at all is a feat in and of itself. 
                    Killarney is an area that has attracted people for over a millennium; this is something that is unlikely to change any time soon.

                <h2>Weather and Climate of Killarney</h2>

                <p> As we may all know, Ireland is known for its <b>mild temperatures</b>, especially for a country found at its latitude. 
                    Ireland is an island, surrounded by water on all sides, and its <b>Temperate Oceanic Climate</b> makes for <b>warm summers</b> and <b>cool winters</b>. 
                    The <i>North Atlantic Current</i> also flows past Kerry, which also factors into Kerry's milder temperatures. 
                    This means that subtropical plants such as strawberry tree and tree ferns, not normally found in northern Europe, thrive in the area. 
                    It also means while other European and North American counterparts see much snow and ice, Killarney does not. 
                    Depending on the person this may be a blessing or a curse.
                </p>

                </figure>

                <p> While its climate makes sure the island never gets too hot or cold, it also punishes the island with <b>rainfall</b>. 
                    Ireland is a wet country, with Killarney even more so. 
                    Being surrounded by mountains causes the moist air coming from the <i>Atlantic Ocean</i> to be forced down in rain. 
                    Killarney has been punished with some of the highest rainfall in Ireland because of this. It definitely has benefited the flora and fauna in Killarney, 
                    with the area having some of the most extensive forests in the country. It also darkens Killarney's mood, 
                    which is a shame for such a beautiful town.

                <h2>Killarney - The Creation of a Tourist Destination</h2>

                <p> How did Killarney become a Tourist Destination?</p>

                <p> Well, Killarney's has a tradition of entertaining visitors, starting from the beginnings of modern tourism over two centuries ago. 
                    Known for its soaring mountains and legendary lakes, tourism in the area was initiated by, 
                    and has continued to this day by Killarney's breath-taking natural beauty. 
                    Ruins and historic sites freckle Killarney's landscape and has lend the area with an aura of mystery. 
                    The town charm also comes from the retained <b>old-style shop fronts</b> and <b>brick footpaths</b>, in-fact since 1980s gaudy plastic shop signs have been banned.
                    Because of this local businesses have competed with one another to have most attractive stores with stained glass doors, old style signs, and windows boxes.
                    This is not to say you will feel as if you've been transported into the pass when visiting Killarney. Luxury hotels are found on every corner, offering the most modern facilities. 
                    All these factors come together to make tourism Killarney's largest industry. </p>

                <p> Like many European towns and cities, Killarney developed naturally, starting off with just a couple of shacks and paths. 
                    The town organically spread, but this means the layout isn't very coherent. 
                    There have been many unsuccessful town planning attempts that took place when the town emerged as a major tourist destination; 
                    the maze of lanes and oddly shaped streets that have resulted lend the town an utterly unique flavour, 
                    offering the visitor a surprise at every corner. Many restaurants and craft stores are hidden down these alleys so exploring is well worth the effort.
                    You can live in Killarney your whole life and still be able to be surprised by the town every day. Tourists love this aspect of Killarney.

                <h2>Here's some things you'll need to know to effectively blend in as a Killarney person.</h2>

                <ul>
                    <li><i>Bird's Bazaar</i> is the <b>Disneyland of Killarney</b>. This fun fair does seem to lose its charm a little more every year, 
                        with this cost-of-living crisis, the prices definitely seem a little dear, and the carpark it finds itself in its definitely pretty small, 
                        but every summer magic happens at Bird's. The kids will boast how they won't be going to Bird's this year, its for little kids, 
                        but they'll still manage to dutifully show up every year, buy candy floss, churros and slushies, ride the rides, and play the games, 
                        show up in fancy dress and their little doodles for five free tickets. Face painting is a must, and who doesn't love the bumpers.
                    </li>
                    <li> <i>St. Finan's</i> is haunted. Having only closed in 2012, most will remember Killarney's psychiatric hospital and how the people were treated in here. 
                        Uninvestigated deaths, mysterious burials, inmates being locked up against their will. The architecture is also just so depressing. 
                        You're friends telling you to get as close as you can get to the building, that they saw something in the windows. 
                        That we'll sneak in next time. It doesn't help if you've played the game Outlast. The nightmares you would get about the place as a kid. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Who doesn't love giving tourists wrong directions. Americans are some of the nicest people around, but they're just so gullible too, 
                        am I right? Who doesn't like to play a game of who can come up with the most ludicrous directions and see if they'll listen. 
                        TK Maxx? Yeah, that's just off the round-a-bout past Lidl. The Post Office? Just over that river there. 
                        The fields a little muddy this time of year though, so don't forget to where some boots. 
                        Just make sure you're not around when the pissed off American's come running back. You'll always have time for a laugh in Killarney.
                    </li>
                    <li><p> Why do Cork even bother showing up for Kerry vs Cork matches. It been almost three decades since they won. 
                            A rivalry that began in 1889, or the dawn of time, why do they even bother? Maybe we just haven't broken down their hope just yet. 
                            They'll still manage to bring an army of supporters with them. Was one of the only times you would feel outnumbered in Killarney. We even have the superior venue.
                        </p>

                        <p> This game is allegedly how Kerry people measure a good summer. Them trashing Cork. 
                            Good luck in getting from Kerry to the vicinity of Cork in any way, shape, or form match night though. Fastest way would probably be walking.
                        </p>
