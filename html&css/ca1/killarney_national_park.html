            <p> <i>Killarney National Park</i> is the enormous park found, as the name suggests, in the town of Killarney. 
                It happens to be the <b>first national park</b> in Ireland, with the park being donated to the <i>Irish Free State</i> in 1932, 
                and till this day remains one of six national parks found in Ireland. The park encompasses over ten-thousand hectares of land, 
                and is home to Ireland highest mountain range and the famous <i>Lakes of Killarney</i>. </p>
                
            <p> From waterfalls to woodlands, there's plenty of remarkable sights to discover here, and it even has some rare flora and fauna, 
                including Ireland's Oak and Yew Woodlands of <b>international importance</b>, and the island's <b>only population of wild red deer.</b> 
                Killarney National Park also has the most <b>extensive covering</b> of native forest in Ireland, 
                and due to all of this, was designated a <i>UNESCO Biosphere Reserve</i> in 1981.
                There's many sights found within the park, but some might consider the nineteenth-century mansion, <i>Muckross House</i> to be it's centrepiece.
                With over a million visitors each year, its the perfect place to go on walks, bikes, hikes, jaunting car rides, 
                and much more. Killarney National Park is made to be explored.</p>
            
            

            <h2>Some Sights found in the World Famous Park</h2>

            <section id="macgillycuddy's_reeks">

                <h3>MacGillycuddy's Reeks</h3>

                <p> <i>The MacGillycuddy's Reeks</i>, known in Irish as <i lang="ga">Na Cruacha Dubha</i>, meaning <i>the black stacks</i> 
                    is an imposing mountain range found in the centre of County Kerry's <i>Iveragh Peninsula</i>, and is Ireland's highest mountain range. 
                    The mountain range stretches over nineteen kilometres, from the <i>Gap of Dunloe</i> in the east, and <i>Glencar</i> in the west. 
                    This vast mountain range is found about twenty kilometres outside the borders of Killarney, 
                    and contains Ireland's tallest mountain <i>Carrauntoohil</i>, which stretches to above <b>one-thousand and thirty-five metres</b>. 
                    It is estimated that one-hundred and forty thousand people visit the range each year, with many aiming to climb its many peaks.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>View of the mountain range from the northwestern end of Caragh Lake</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p> Although people do climb the mountain year round, the best time to do so would be between the months of April and September.
                    So if you're reading this at a time between these months, maybe this is your sign to give climbing these epic peaks a go.
                    We do only recommend experienced climbers to give this journey a go, but as we till this day keep on having to say its "not a walk in the park",
                    its highly unlikely you'll listen anyways.

                    <h4>Carrauntoohil</h4>

                    <p> <i>Carrauntoohil</i>, or <i lang="ga">Corrán Tuathail</i> in Irish, meaning <i>Tuathal's Sickle</i> 
                        or <i>Inverted Sickle</i> is the tallest mountain of not only the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, 
                        but of all Ireland. As its the tallest mountain Ireland, its one of the most popular mountains in Ireland to climb, 
                        and most people due so via the <i>Devil's Ladder route</i>. The mountain does have a sort of bad reputation for being moody, 
                        with ever changing weather conditions, and with the descent path being slippery and steep and covered with rocks,
                        safety is a major worry. But the lovely sign at the summit "Turn Back Now, No Descent Route" must be a lovely scene to climbers.</p>

                <h3>Lakes of Killarney</h3>

                </figure>

                <p> Killarney is also famous for its lakes. Found at the heart of Killarney National Park and surrounded by the MacGillycuddy's Reeks, 
                    the Lakes of Killarney are a breath-taking beauty that more than one and a half million people every year visit Killarney to witness.
                    The lakes take up about a quarter of the park, with three lakes a part of this group, <i>Lough Leane</i>, <i>Muckross Lake</i> and <i>Upper Lake</i>. 
                    Each being studded with little forested islands,
                    and found on their eastern shore, the historic sites of <i>Muckross Abbey</i> and <i>Ross Castle</i>. While not the biggest or deepest in Ireland, 
                    these lakes aren't lakes you should waver your safety around, with the deepest point comparable to the <em>sheer height</em> of Killarney's cathedral.
                    Safety issues aside, its a highly recommended sight to see, but with the amount of people flocking there every year, 
                    saying this almost becomes unnecessary.

                    <h4>Lough Leane</h4>

                    <p> <i>Lough Leane</i>, <i>"The Lower Lake"</i>, referred to in Irish as <i lang="ga">Loch Léin</i>, has the meaning <i>lake of learning</i>. 
                        Its the closest of the Lakes of Killarney to Killarney, and also happens to be the biggest of these lakes. 
                        Its name most likely is in reference to the monastery on <i>Innisfallen</i>, an island in the lake, 
                        as Innisfallen was a centre of scholarship during the Middle Ages.
                    </p>

                    <p> Lough Leane flows into our second lake, <i>Muckross Lake</i>, also known as the <i>Middle Lake</i>. 
                        The Lakes of Killarney's deepest point is found here, reaching to seventy-five metres in some parts. 
                        In Irish folklore, a mysterious creature, known as <i>Muckie</i>, is reported to dwell in the depths of this lake.
                        Some may say its only seals or whatnot, but we have proof. In 2003, a series of sonar scans recorded a large solid object in the lake, 
                        so something is down there. But what?

                <h3>Some of Killarney's Other Areas of Natural Beauty</h3>

                <p> Killarney is known for its natural beauty. This isn't an opinion but a fact. But being an area so chalk filled with beautiful scenery,
                    its quite easy to forget the mention of one of two. Killarney is an area with an infinite number of areas of natural beauty; here are just a few of these of note</p>

                <section id="gap_of_dunloe">

                    <h4>The Gap of Dunloe</h4>

                    <p> <i>Gap of Dunloe</i> or <i lang="ga">Dún Lóich</i> in Irish, meaning <i lang="ga">Lóich's</i> <i>fort</i> or <i>stronghold</i>, 
                        is a narrow mountain pass found in-between Killarney's famous MacGillycuddy's Reeks and the <i>Purple</i> 
                        and <i>Tomies</i> mountains, and is one of Killarney's most famous natural attractions. <i lang="ga">Lóich</i> was the first leader of an ancient tribe called the <i>Fir Bolg</i>.
                        The <i>River Loe</i> runs through the Gap of Dunloe, 
                        its name also comes from the same source as the Gap of Dunloe. The Gap formed around twenty-five thousand years ago during Ireland's last ice age in result of glacier, 
                        originally found in the <i>Black Valley</i> and part of the <i>Templenoe Icecap</i>, breaking through the Head of the Gap and moving northwards carving out a U-shaped valley. 
                        There is evidence of the Gap existing in some shape and form back over two million years ago though. 
                        Either way the Gap of Dunloe has been a major sight in Killarney for all recorded history in Killarney.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p> Killarney became a huge tourist destination after Queen Victoria's visit to the area, with many famous visitors inspired by the Queens visit to come to Killarney. 
                        The Gap of Dunloe captivated visitors with its views of the lakes and mountains, and its rugged wilderness, 
                        and visitors of note to the area were Romantic poets <i>William Thackery</i> and <i>Alfred Lord Tennyson</i>. 
                        Back then the Gap was nicknamed the <i>Valley of Echoes</i> due to the way sound reverberated along the valley and off the mountains. 
                        It became a tradition to “wake the valley”  by blowing a horn known as a bugle.
                    </p>

                    <p> Nestled at the entrance to the Gap of Dunloe you'll find <i>Kate Kearney's Cottage</i>, a 150-year-old family run establishment with a great history behind it. 
                        <i>Kate Kearney</i> was an exceptional woman who spent her life catering to tired travellers. You see she distilled a potent <i lang="ga">poitín</i>, an Irish moonshine, 
                        which she named <i>Kate Kearney's Mountain Dew</i>. 
                        The stuff was so strong it could not be drunk with at least seven times its quantity of water to temper it. 
                        It was illegal but Kate studiously ignored these laws and continued to brew and sell the drink to visitors in need of reviving. What a generous woman.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p> Today visitors can hike or take a jaunting car through the Gap starting from Kate Kearney's Cottage. However, we recommend taking a ride through the Lakes of Killarney 
                        and to the top of the Gap, and then take the beautiful walk down through the Gap. 
                        However way you choose to visit the Gap of Dunloe, it is one of Killarney's must-see attractions. It can be assured you'll regret missing it if you do.

                <section id="torc_waterfall">

                    <h4>Torc Waterfall</h4>

                    <p> Torc Waterfall, or <i lang="ga">Easach Toirc</i> in Irish, meaning 'cascade of the wild boar' is a twenty-metre high 
                        and one hundred long cascade waterfall formed by the <i>Owengarrif River</i>. The waterfall is a beautiful attraction, even more so after a heavy rain downpour. 
                        While some may see the area as the perfect photo opportunity, this is doing the Waterfall a disservice.</p>

                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/killarney_torc_waterfall.jpg" alt="A birds eye view of Torc Waterfall">
                    </figure>

                    <p> The area's name comes from legends involving boars. One such tail details a main who was cursed by the Devil to be turned each night into a wild boar. 
                        He lived in a cavern underneath <i>Torc Mountain</i> where the present waterfall is located and stayed there to avoid being killed and eaten. 
                        His secret was discovered by a local farmer, and in his anger of his secret being revealed to others, it is said he burst into a ball of flames 
                        and disappeared into the <i>Devils Punchbowl</i>. The lake-water burst forth and the waterfall was created to hide the Boar's cavern beneath the waterfall.</p>

                    <p> Legends aside this is quite the popular destinations. 
                        It's definitely recommended to take the steps besides the waterfall, which lead to another viewing point at a higher area that provides magnificent view of the Middle Lake. 
                        The Waterfall may be a crowded area, but it's another one of Killarney's must sees.

                <section  id="ross_castle">

                    <h4>Ross Castle</h4>

                    <p> <i>Ross Castle</i> is a castle that is perched in an inlet of <i>Lough Leane</i>, and was thought to have been built by <i>O'Donoghue Mór</i>, 
                        an Irish chieftain, in the fifteenth century. Legends state O'Donoghue sleeps under the waters of the lake, 
                        and that on the first morning of May every seven years, he may be observed to <b>rise</b> from the waters on his magnificent white horse.
                        Anyone that catches a glimpse of him is said to be assured of <b>good fortune</b> for their rest of their lives. 
                        But all you're likely to see in the time in-between is ducks in the waters (and no, bread is in fact not healthy for ducks). 
                        Ross Castle was also the last place in Munster to hold out against Cromwell, 
                        where a prophecy foretold that the castle could only be taken by a ship, so the <i>Cromwellians</i> decided to launch a boat into the lake. 
                        Surrender came fast.
                    </p>

                    </figure>

                    <p> Today the castle and the surrounding land is peaceful, the perfect picture of tranquillity. 
                        The castle has recently been restored and is open to visitors from April to October, 
                        but you can still stroll around the grounds throughout the year. 
                        Many boat trips to the Island of <i>Innisfallen</i> and <i>the Lakes of Killarney</i> can be found and originate here.

                    <p> Muckross House is located in the <i>Killarney National Park</i> on the small <i>Muckross Peninsula</i> between <i>Muckross Lake</i> and <i>Lough Leane</i>.
                        The House was built in the nineteenth century, 
                        and most of the house has been preserved as a late nineteenth century mansion, with furniture and artefacts from that period.
                        You'll find <i>Muckross Gardens</i> to be adjoined to Muckross House, 
                        which also date back to the mid-nineteenth century when extensive landscaping was carried in preparation for Queen Victoria's visit in 1861.
                        If you find walking the extensive gardens too fatiguing, a Jaunting Car Tour through them may be the perfect solution.
                        And just as the Park the House finds itself in, Muckross House was presented to the <i>Irish Free State</i> in 1932. 
                    </p>

                    <p> If you ever would like to learn how life was like in the early twentieth century, maybe visiting House is the perfect attraction.
                        Located near the House you'll find <i>Muckross Traditional Farms</i>, a place that allows visitors to explore the workings of a farm, 
                        and the traditional way of life of Killarney people in the 1930s. Its a shame the farms are closed from November to March.

                    <h4>Innisfallen</h4>

                    <p> Situated at the Heart of Killarney, as the biggest island within Lough Leane, we find the enchanting <i>Innisfallen island</i>, 
                        or <i lang="ga">Inis Faithlinn</i> in Irish, meaning <i>Faithlinn's Island</i>. The island is about twenty-one acres, 
                        mostly wooded, with undulating hills and many slopes. But what makes the island so compelling is the Abbey found on the Island.
                    </p>

                    <p> 
                        The ruins of <i>Innisfallen Abbey</i> are what occupy the island today, with the structure often credited to have been built by <i>St Finan the leper</i>, 
                        called so for having cured a young boy of leprosy. The original structure was built in 640, 
                        but its hard to picture what it may have looked like, 
                        as the ruins you'll see on the island today are from more later twelfth century Augustinian priory and Romanesque church. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This far-off island may seem inconsequential, but it was a <b>centre of education</b> in the early Christian world. 
                        Ireland was known as the island of saints and scholars in the past, and Innisfallen played a great part in establishing this reputation, 
                        with the meaning of Lough Leane's name in Irish <i>lake of learning</i> being evidence of this. 
                        The Abbey was of so high status that the Irish High King Brian Boru is said to have even gotten his formative education here. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The monks of the island were disposed of by <i>Queen Elizabeth I</i>. But before this could be done, over a period of three-hundred years, 
                        the <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i> were written, which chronicles the early history of Ireland as known to the monks. 
                        It may seem a little ironic so that the same people that brought the demise of the island has possession of the Annals, 
                        but hope still remains Oxford will one day return the important scriptures to Killarney.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The island is open to the public all year round, however landing is subject to weather and availability of boats.  
                        Swimming to the island is not recommended, best left to the fish and deer 
                        - if you're lucky you may spot some deer swimming to the island when the lake is calm. Whatever method you choose to visit the island, 
                        you are guaranteed to have rememberable day. Visiting Innisfallen is a must.
