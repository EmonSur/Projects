            <h2 id="intro">Killarney: A Town with an Enthralling History</h2>

            <p> Killarney has been known, for most of its history, for its stunning <b>natural beauty</b> and world-famous lakes. 
                But there is so much more to the town than just its aesthetic qualities. 
                Killarney is a town that is steeped in history and has been the site of many famous battles. 
                Killarney should not be known exclusively for its nature; but for <b>deep history</b> too.</p>

            <section id="prehistoric_killarney">

                <h3>Prehistoric Times</h3>

                <p> Killarney's unique history began with the last <i>Ice Age</i>, The entire region now known as Killarney was once covered with a single ice sheet, 
                    and as this ice melted, Killarney's magnificent peaks were created. Gravel and boulders were pushed aside, 
                    creating the winding passes of <i>Molls Gap</i> and the <i>Gap of Dunloe</i>. The retreating ice also created Killarney's mysterious lakes. 
                    Killarney has been favoured by mother nature since its creation.
                </p>

                    <figcaption>Here we see the winding path of the Gap of Dunloe.</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p> For thousands of years, Killarney's spots of natural beauty were the town's only occupants of note. 
                    Then came the phenomena of human life into the area around four-thousand years ago. 
                    Killarney's first residents happened to be the <i>Bronze Age Beaker Folk</i>, 
                    receiving their name from their distinctive bell-shaped beakers they carried. 
                    They mined copper on <i>Ross Island</i>, creating the first copper mines of north-western Europe. These people did not tend to themselves, 
                    in-fact they led prosperous lives with strong trade ties to the Continent. <i>Lunula</i>, or gold collars were big exports at the time. 
                    Bronze weapons have been found in the area, but the Beaker people were <b>peaceful farmers</b>.
                </p>
	                
                <p> Invaders started coming to Killarney in 500 BC, and culturally changed the area, 
                    with the <i>Pictish tribes</i> from the north of Ireland the first invaders, known for their blue woad tattoos. 
                    These people practiced polyandry and had matrilineal succession, and some may say society has <em>regressed</em> ever since. 
                    According to legend, the ruling tribe in Killarney was descended from <i>Queen Mebh's</i> son <i>Cair</i> and was known as the <i>Ciarraige</i>, 
                    which translates to <i>Cairs Kingdom</i>. It is from this the name 'Kerry' is derived.
                </p>
    
                <p> In approximately 400 BC, came with the arrival of the <i>Fir Bolg</i>, 
                    meaning <i>bag men</i> thought to have been called so for exporting Irish earth to Greece to protect their cities from snakes. 
                    Yes, we were known for our lack of snakes even way back then.
                    The Fir Bolg were a <i>Celtic people</i>, who gave Ireland some of its richest legends, including the tales of <i>Cuchulainn</i>, <i>Curoi</i>, and <i>Deidre</i>. 
                    These people also built many forts in Killarney, and developed <i>Ogham script</i>, fine examples of which can be found near Killarney.
                </p>

                <section id="ogham_stone">

                    <h4>Dunloe Ogham Stones</h4>

                    <p> Located between <i>Beaufort Village</i> and <i>the Gap of Dunloe</i>, we find the Dunloe Ogham Stones. 
                        Ogham stones are stones on which short 'marks' or 'notches' were made to signify letters and sounds, 
                        and they make up the <b>first written form</b> of the Irish language, and date back to the third century BC. In Dunloe there are a group of these stones, 
                        which stand in a group of eight and serve as burial markers. They all vary in size and colour, but all carry clear Ogham inscriptions. 
                        Seven of these stones were found in a nearby souterrain at <i>Coolmagort</i> where, believe it or not, they were reused as lintels for a roof.  
                        Having been away from elements from such a long time is what saved them from weathering. 
                        You can only imagine how many of such stones existed in Ireland but have been lost to the elements.

                <h3>Early Christian Ireland</h3>

                <p> Killarney featured prominently in early Irish history, with religious settlements playing an important part of its recorded history. 
                    The first Christian communities were established in Killarney in around 400 AD, with the first settlement established at <i>Aghadoe</i>, 
                    most likely by <i>St Abban</i>, a missionary of <i>St Patrick</i>. For many people of Killarney, a lot of old <b>pagan</b> festivals and rites were 
                    incorporated into the Christianity they practiced, creating a sort of pseudo-hybrid religion.
                    Monasteries were erected in <i>Aghadoe</i> and <i>Innisfallen Island</i>.

                    <p>	Overlooking Lough Leane, the town of Killarney, and the misty mountains beyond, we find Aghadoe. 
                        The place takes its name from the Irish <i lang="ga">Achadh an Dá Eó</i>,  meaning the <i>'field of two yews'</i>. 
                        It is thought the are originated as a <b>Pagan Religious site</b>. 
                        Its chronicled in the <i>Annals of Innisfallen</i> that <i>St Finan the leper</i> founded a monastery in Aghadoe in the seventh century. 
                        Alongside the monastery founded on <i>Innisfallen</i>, Aghadoe Monastery is thought to have been an important <b>centre of learning</b>.

                <h3>The Making of a Tourism Destination</h3>

                <p> Killarney continued as a small market town until 1750. At this point, 
                    <i>Viscount Kenmare</i> seeing a great promotional opportunity decided to <em>capitalize</em> on Killarney's natural beauty. 
                    He invested in roads, boat facilities, and gave out long leases for new inns. Killarney became the place to be and by 1780, 
                    even the bishop of Kerry moved here. With the continued encouragement of the Viscount, <i>St Mary's Cathedral</i>, <i>St Mary's Church of Ireland</i>,
                    <i>the Presentation Convent</i>, and a new <i>Franciscan Friary</i> were all built in the nineteenth century.
                </p> 

                <p> <i>Queen Victoria's</i> visit to Killarney cemented the town's reputation as a Grand Tour destination. In 1861, with an entourage of one hundred, 
                    the Royal Party arrived. Before the Queen's visit there was not much need for high-class accommodation. 
                    Luxury accommodation and a new road network linking Killarney to Limerick, Cork and Kenmare were created. The Panorama on the <i>Muckross Estate</i>, 
                    enjoyed by her ladies-in-waiting, dubbed <i>Ladies View</i> became another Killarney destination.

                <h3>Famine in Killarney</h3>

                <p> Killarney's long reign of prosperity sadly halted in the autumn of 1845 when a <b>potato blight</b> struck Ireland. 
                    Although not one of the most affected areas in Ireland, Killarney was still severely affected by the famine. 
                    Killarney's workhouse was soon overflowing and the partially built St. Mary's Cathedral was used as a fever hospital and shelter for the needy.

                <p>
                    The Californian Redwood found on the grounds of the cathedral became a mass grave for hundreds of infants and children. Thousand died, 
                    and thousand more emigrated elsewhere. It came as a relief when the famine ended.

                <h3>War of Independence in Killarney</h3>

                <p> For all its republican heritage a conception has existed for some time that Kerry was inactive during the <i>Irish War Independence</i>. 
                    Maybe this came from the cautious nature of some of the IRA leaders in the county. However, during the early 20th century, 
                    Killarney was to become embroiled in fighting in the Irish War of Independence. The town, and indeed the entire county has strong republic tides,
                    and regular skirmishes occurred in the town with the British forces. Killarney also played a role in the conclusion of the war. 
                    It was here that the <b>final act</b> of war took place, just 15 minutes before the ceasefire came into effect. <i>Hannah Carey</i>, 
                    a waitress of the Imperial Hotel was the last victim of this brutal war.</p>

                <h3>Killarney Today</h3>

                <p> Killarney is a town that has been steeped in rich history since its dawn. It was first and foremost a land of otherworldly natural beauty, 
                    and human-kinds' legacy on the land only adds to the place's charm. Some may see Killarney as overrated due its popularity, 
                    but we cannot fault the land for the people on it. Killarney and it's history deserves to be cherished.
