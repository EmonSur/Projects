      <h2>About Dungeon Dash</h2>
      <p> Play as a wizard, captured by his arch nemesis and trapped in a Dungeon. He must make it through room after room of deadly bats, all trying to get a turn to eat his flesh.
          This should be a piece of cake for our heroic wizard, but- Oh No! His powers are missing.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Multiple levels, all with increasing difficulties.</li>
        <li>Best time feature that will help you see how you stack up against previous tries.</li>
        <li>Power-ups to help you beat the more difficult levels.</li>
      </ul>
