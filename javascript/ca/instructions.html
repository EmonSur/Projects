            <h1>Dungeon Dash Instructions</h1>
            <p>Welcome to Dungeon Dash, the ultimate test of your reflexes and gaming skills!</p>
            <p>In this game, you will need to guide your player character across the canvas, dodging enemies and obstacles along the way. Here's how to play:</p>

            <h2>Gameplay</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Press the up arrow once to make the player character jump.</li>
                <li>If you manage to get to the other side of the canvas without colliding with an enemy, you win!</li>
                <li>If you hit an enemy, you will be returned to the starting point and have to try again.</li>
                <li>You have three lives before you lose.</li>
                <li>The game has four levels, each with increasing numbers and speeds of enemies.</li>
                <li>Each level has three difficulties: easy, medium, and hard.</li>
                <li>The game is timed, and the fastest players for each level can make it onto the leaderboard. Don't take too long though, as a game is automatically lost at 2 minutes.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>Note: You may need to resize your window to fit the whole canvas. Please do so if need be.</p>

            <h2>Power ups</h2>
            <p>The game also features several power ups that can be accessed by pressing certain keys:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Ghost Mode (Press G): Ignores all collisions with enemies and allows you to pass through them.</li>
                <li>Time Freeze Mode (Press F): Freezes enemies in their place on the screen.</li>
                <li>Immortal Mode (Press I): Gives you unlimited lives.</li>
                <li>Assault Mode (Press A): Allows you to shoot enemies by pressing the space bar.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You may enter as many modes as you want at the same time. Mix and match, it's up to you.</p>
            <p>To exit a mode, simply press the corresponding key again.</p>
