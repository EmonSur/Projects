Losts of things can be stored on a web-server - another word for this is hosted.

> **Difference between server-side program and client-side program**:
<ul><li>Sending a request for a client-side program, sends a copy of the progam (the code) back. The only language really that is used in this type of program is JavaScript.</li>
<li>Sending a request for a server-side program, executes the program at the Web server computer, and the output from the program is what is sent back. 
<li>The difference is where they execute.</li></ul>

> **Into the .flaskenv file, we must have the following at the start**;
<code>FLASK_APP=app.py</code>
<code>FLASK_DEBUG=True</code>

---
> **Into the app.py file, we must have the following at the start of every program**;
<code> from flask import Flask </code>
<code> app = Flask(__name__)</code>

We can name this variable whatever we want, but generally it is called **app**.

<code>@app.route("/")</code> - In python, lines starting with an @ just before a function are called **Decorators**. These *Decorators* have many uses - the only use we will find in CS1116 is **routes**.

**Routes** - In flask a route = decorator + view function. They specify how URLs relate to functions.


**NB: In the terminal we need to be in the same folder as our code is.**

Into the terminal we will then type <code>flask run</code>. This will create a temporary server.
To kill a server, we can type in ctrl c, or just exit out of VSCode.


The port number for this will be 5000.
The pathname will be what is inside the quotation marks in <code>@app.route("")</code>

**How to get todays date and time**:
Using the code <code> from datetime import datetime</code>
In a function, we will then return <code>datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S %d-%m_%y")</code> - This isn't in string so we must use **strftime()**, which is used to convert date and time objects to their string representation.

---

**How to get a random choice from a list:**
Using the code <code>from random import choices</code>
In a function, we will return <code> choices(list_name)</code>

---
If we want to put data into a URL - we will put at the end of the route  /<data> -  This will act as a placeholder, and in our URL, will place some piece of data.

We can have more than one route for the same view function.

We can have an error handler route <code> @app.errorhandler(404)</code>
When this error occurs we can have a function which returns a message, instead of getting the typically "Not Found" message.
