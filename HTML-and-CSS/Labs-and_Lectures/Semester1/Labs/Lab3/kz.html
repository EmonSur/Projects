                        <p>Mrs Barb Dwyer of Ballincollig wrote to tell us of a fun <b>event</b>. She and her friends planned a week of dinners at each others' houses - a kind of do-it-yourself version of the TV series <i>Come Dine With Me.</i> What a great idea! Unfortunately, the dinners were abandoned mid-week when all four friends contracted <em>Salmonella enterocolitis</em> from undercooked quail eggs.</p>

                <h2 id="months_recipe">This Month's Recipe: Vegetarian Stew</h2>
                <p>This month's recipe has been sent in by Colonel Ray Ling from Clonmel. He writes: “This was a great favourite among the boys of my command when we were stationed in the foothills of the Transdanubian Mountains in Hungary. The locals refer to it as <i lang="hu">pörkölt,</i> but we just called it stew. It's deliciously warming and only 500 calories.” It sounds great, Ray! Ye all let us know how you get on with it.</p>
